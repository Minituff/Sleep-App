# Overview

This is one of my earliest Flutter projects. I built this in an attempt to copy the UI of [this Dribble mockup](https://dribbble.com/shots/6870298-Sleep-App).


## The front-end

<img title="demo" src="media/demo.gif" width="360" height="780"/>

# Source Material
Based on [this mock-up](https://dribbble.com/shots/6870298-Sleep-App)

<img title="demo" src="media/based_on_1.png" width="800" height="600"/>
<p float="left">
  <img title="demo" src="media/based_on_2.png" width="375" height="812"/>
  <img title="demo" src="media/based_on_3.png" width="375" height="812"/>
</p>

## Notes

It should be noted that this project is very old and outdated. Most of the Flutter code uses depracated sytax and methods. This project is not connected to a back-end and is UI only.
